## What does the regular session look like?
Meeting are held online. Zoom meeting invites are through our group chatting.

Currently we are going over one or two chapters of the book, Think Python.
From November, the session will turn into project group meetings.
Even during the project phase, basic Python programming review sessions will be offered for new commers or for those who need refreshers. 

## What does the study time look like? 
We meet online, bringing our own study material.
Most of time, we silently read the material or practice programming. 
If needed, one-on-one or group discussions can be initiated by any attendee.
Please send me the organizer a zoom private textmessage for one-on-one discussion.
